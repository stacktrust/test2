# OpenXCI

> "... is a Xen-based desktop hypervisor. Unlike other desktop hypervisors, it is not targeted at businesses wanting remote provisioning, but rather at individuals who want a high-performance alternative to dual/multi-booting."

# Ethos OS

> "... provides stronger security services which are more resistant to attack and abstractions which are less prone to abuse by attackers. As an example of the former, all networking in Ethos is encrypted, authenticated, and authorized. As an example of the latter, Ethos I/O is typed (as in programming languages) ensuring that I/O conforms to declared types and thus preventing many attacks based on ill-formed input."
