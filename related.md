### Cappsule

> "x86-64 Linux hypervisor ... virtualize any software on the fly (e.g. web browser, office suite, media player) into lightweight VMs called cappsules. Attacks are confined inside cappsules and therefore donât have any impact on the host OS. Applications donât need to be repackaged, and their usage remain the same for the end user"

- Quarkslab, [software](https://github.com/cappsule) &middot; [overview](https://blog.quarkslab.com/on-the-fly-virtualization-with-cappsule.html), *France*

### Ethos OS

> "... provides stronger security services which are more resistant to attack and abstractions which are less prone to abuse by attackers. As an example of the former, all networking in Ethos is encrypted, authenticated, and authorized. As an example of the latter, Ethos I/O is typed (as in programming languages) ensuring that I/O conforms to declared types and thus preventing many attacks based on ill-formed input."
