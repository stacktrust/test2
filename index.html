OpenXT is an open-source development toolkit for hardware-assisted security research and appliance integration. It includes hardened <a href="http://www.xenproject.org">Xen</a> VMs that can be configured as a user-facing virtualization appliance, for client devices with Linux and/or Windows guests.  

<br><br>

It has been used to develop managed software appliances to isolate demanding graphics workloads, untrusted workloads and multiple networks on a single laptop or desktop.
OpenXT is optimized for x86 devices with Intel <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-virtualization-technology-for-directed-io-vt-d-enhancing-intel-platforms-for-efficient-virtualization-of-io-devices">VT-d</a>, <a href="https://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/intel_txt.txt">TXT</a> (Trusted Execution Technology) and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module">TPM</a>.
