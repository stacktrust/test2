Released as Open-Source Software (OSS) in [June 2014](http://www.slideshare.net/xen_com_mgr/tricca-xen-summit2014), OpenXT stands on the shoulders of [Xen Project](http://xen.org) and [OpenEmbedded](http://openembedded.org).  It is derived from XenClient XT, which was first released in [May 2011](http://www.citrix.com/news/announcements/may-2011/citrix-announces-xenclient-2-and-xenclient-xt.html).

OpenXT is being developed to meet the varied needs of the security and virtualization communities, as a toolkit for the configurable [disaggregation](http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Dom0_Disaggregation) of operating systems and user workflows.
